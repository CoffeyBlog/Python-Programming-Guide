# Assigning-Variables

x = 12.2
y = 1

print(x + y) # The answer should obviously be 13.2


# However if we now say:

x = 100

print(x + y) # it should say: 101

# and that is because when you assign the numerical value of 100 to "x" it the deletes or overides the previously assigned 12.2




# Type conversion

# When you have two strings in Python...:

a = "1"
b = "2"

# ... and you add them

print("a" + "b")

# ... pythons response is to concatenate them or "push them together" for example

c = "hola"
d = " amigo"

print(c + d)


# if you would like to convert strings to numbers ... all you have to do is type cast to integer:

e = int(a) + int(b)
print(e)



# To help ... identify the  Variable / Operator / Constant / & Functions
