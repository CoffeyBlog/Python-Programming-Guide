# Math

# One important thing to know about Python is an int is way more faster than using a float.
# Therefore if you can avoid using a float, and instead use an int ... by all means do it.

a = 21       #integer
b = 7        #integer


# An expression is anything that can be calculated and return a value ... here are the most elementary forms of expressions


print(a + b) #addition expression

print(a - b) #subtraction expression

print(a * b) #multiplication expression

print(a / b) #divided by expression - in python division is always returned as float

print(a // b) # whole number division expression -- value returned as int (becareful this can really screw you up due to the lack of presicion)

print(a % b) # modulous expression (gives only the remainedr of a operation)

print(a ** b) # to the power of / exponent
